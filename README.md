## Objective
Identify a data set and based on the data set and phenomenon ask 2 questions that would highlight something interesting about the data or phenomenon. 

## Dataset Description
The dataset titled “Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes” was obtained from the U.S. government’s open data portal at data.gov. The dataset consisted of 1,048,576 rows and 30 columns where each row corresponds to a single crash event, and each column represents a specific attribute of that event. For example, the date and time of the crash, the borough and ZIP code, geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), street names, and counts of injuries or fatalities. Individuals were categorized as pedestrian, cyclist, or motorist. The dataset included contributing factors for up to five vehicles (driver inattention, unsafe speed, etc.). And vehicle types (Passenger Vehicle, Taxi, Bus, etc). Data types differed by column. Borough names and contributing factors as strings, geographical data as scientific numbers, and date and time as qualitative data. Essentially, this dataset assists the NYPD in supporting citywide traffic safety in New York, and our group in answering two very important questions.  

## Question 1

How have car crashes changed year over year in the different Boroughs?

Why is this important?

1. Identifies Local Trends and Problem Areas
Each borough has unique traffic patterns, infrastructure, and population density. Analyzing year-over-year changes helps pinpoint where crashes are increasing or decreasing, showing which areas may need more safety interventions or policy attention.

2. Measures the Effectiveness of Safety Initiatives
New York has implemented several traffic safety programs. Tracking changes by borough allows policymakers to evaluate whether these efforts are working in specific areas — for example, if crashes declined more in Manhattan than in Queens, it might suggest that certain local policies are more effective.

3. Reveals Impacts of Major Events or Conditions
Year-over-year data captures how external events — such as state-wide lockdowns, weather patterns, or infrastructure changes — affect crash rates.

This map shows the spatial distribution of car crashes across New York City’s five boroughs. Each borough is color-coded, helping visualize where incidents occur most frequently. This geographic overview sets the stage for analyzing how trends differ across areas and over time.

This line chart displays the total number of car crashes in New York City from 2013 to 2024. The data show a steady increase in crashes leading up to 2018–2019, followed by a sharp decline beginning in 2020. The dramatic drop corresponds with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns and reduced traffic volume significantly lowered crash counts. Although traffic gradually resumed in subsequent years, crash numbers have remained below pre-pandemic levels, suggesting a lasting shift in driving behavior or commuting patterns.

Before the pandemic, crash levels varied by borough but followed generally stable or slightly declining patterns. Brooklyn and Queens consistently reported the highest crash counts, reflecting their dense populations and extensive road networks. Manhattan and Staten Island showed gradual declines, possibly due to traffic-calming initiatives and enforcement of Vision Zero policies (An effort to have zero injuries or deaths in vehicle related incidents by prioritizing safety in the design of cities). The Bronx exhibited a modest upward trend, indicating localized increases in crash frequency. Overall, this period captures a relatively steady pre-COVID baseline.

After 2020, every borough saw a noticeable reduction in crash volume, with the steepest declines occurring in 2020 when travel restrictions were strongest. Brooklyn and Queens still lead in total crashes, but both saw significant downward trends. The Bronx’s crash numbers dropped sharply before stabilizing, while Manhattan’s decrease may reflect reduced commuter and tourist traffic. Staten Island remains comparatively low and stable. These post-COVID years highlight the pandemic’s enduring impact on urban mobility — fewer vehicles on the road have translated to fewer collisions citywide.

## Question 2

What is the leading cause of car crashes in New York?

This is an important question for multiple reasons

1. Improves Road Safety Policies
Knowing what causes most crashes helps city planners and law enforcement design targeted safety measures.

2. Guides Infrastructure and Urban Design
Understanding crash causes helps transportation departments prioritize road improvements.

3. Helps Allocate Resources Effectively
Police, traffic engineers, and city agencies can focus their efforts where they’ll have the biggest impact.

4. Informs Public Awareness and Education
When the city knows which behaviors cause the most crashes, it can educate drivers more effectively.

5. Reduces Economic and Social Costs
Crashes have huge economic costs — from medical bills and property damage to lost productivity.
By addressing root causes, the city can save lives and reduce financial strain on residents and emergency services.

6. Supports Long-Term Vision Zero Goals
New York City’s Vision Zero initiative aims to eliminate traffic deaths. Understanding contributing factors provides the evidence base needed to measure progress and plan future interventions.

This bar chart highlights the leading causes of vehicle collisions in New York. The most significant contributing factor by far is Driver Inattention or Distraction, accounting for approximately 450,000 crashes — more than double any other cause. This emphasizes how behaviors such as texting, phone use, or general lack of focus are the primary risks on New York’s roads.

The next most common factors are Failure to Yield Right of Way and Following Too Closely, each contributing over 100,000 incidents, suggesting that impatience and aggressive driving behaviors play a substantial role in urban collisions. Other noted factors include Backing Unsafely, Passing or Lane Usage Improperly, and Other Vehicular causes, each responsible for tens of thousands of crashes.

Overall, the data indicate that human error — particularly distraction and poor driving decisions — is the dominant cause of car crashes in New York, underscoring the need for ongoing driver awareness campaigns and enforcement of distracted driving laws.

This graph shows the total number of collisions by the hour of the day. The X-axis represents the 24 hours of the day (from 0 to 23), and the Y-axis shows the "Count of Collision Id" (the number of crashes).

Lowest Point: Crashes are at their lowest between 3:00 AM and 4:00 AM (hours 3-4).

Morning Peak: There is a significant spike in crashes around 8:00 AM (hour 8), which aligns with the morning rush hour.

Evening Peak: The number of crashes is highest during the evening commute, peaking around 4:00 PM (hour 16) and remaining very high from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM (hours 14-18).

It is true that time is not a factor in crashes the same way that distracted driving is. However, time plays a factor regarding possible grogginess when individuals are first waking up and going to work as well as the exhaustion of the workday and a correllation of increased crashes at that time.
