## Objective
Identify a data set and based on the data set and phenomenon ask 2 questions that would highlight something interesting about the data or phenomenon. 

## Question 1

How have car crashes changed year over year in the different Bouroughs?

This map shows the spatial distribution of car crashes across New York City’s five boroughs. Each borough is color-coded, helping visualize where incidents occur most frequently. This geographic overview sets the stage for analyzing how trends differ across areas and over time.

This line chart displays the total number of car crashes in New York City from 2013 to 2024. The data show a steady increase in crashes leading up to 2018–2019, followed by a sharp decline beginning in 2020. The dramatic drop corresponds with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns and reduced traffic volume significantly lowered crash counts. Although traffic gradually resumed in subsequent years, crash numbers have remained below pre-pandemic levels, suggesting a lasting shift in driving behavior or commuting patterns.

Before the pandemic, crash levels varied by borough but followed generally stable or slightly declining patterns. Brooklyn and Queens consistently reported the highest crash counts, reflecting their dense populations and extensive road networks. Manhattan and Staten Island showed gradual declines, possibly due to traffic-calming initiatives and enforcement of Vision Zero policies (An effort to have zero injuries or deaths in vehicle related incidents by prioritizing safety in the design of cities). The Bronx exhibited a modest upward trend, indicating localized increases in crash frequency. Overall, this period captures a relatively steady pre-COVID baseline.

After 2020, every borough saw a noticeable reduction in crash volume, with the steepest declines occurring in 2020 when travel restrictions were strongest. Brooklyn and Queens still lead in total crashes, but both saw significant downward trends. The Bronx’s crash numbers dropped sharply before stabilizing, while Manhattan’s decrease may reflect reduced commuter and tourist traffic. Staten Island remains comparatively low and stable. These post-COVID years highlight the pandemic’s enduring impact on urban mobility — fewer vehicles on the road have translated to fewer collisions citywide.

## Question 2

What is the leading cause of car crashes in New York?
